Welcome to the **HOPE Thoracic Repository**, a resource for heart and lung transplant programs interested in launching pilot programs for **HIV D+/R+ transplants** (“HOPE transplants”).

---

### Background
Investigators across the U.S. are preparing for a nationwide trial of HIV D+/R+ transplants, planned for launch in **2027**.  
In the meantime, updated federal laws now allow centers to establish their own independent **HIV D+/R+ heart transplant programs**.
