## About This Site

The **HOPE Thoracic Repository** is a collaborative resource for heart and lung transplant programs interested in launching pilot programs for **HIV D+/R+ transplants**.

This site was created to: - Share protocols, sample documents, and best practices - Connect programs interested in HOPE transplants - Provide updates on upcoming clinical trials and regulatory changes

Our materials are intended for transplant centers, clinicians, researchers, and other stakeholders working to expand access to transplantation for people living with HIV.
